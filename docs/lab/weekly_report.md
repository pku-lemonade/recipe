# Weekly Report

## Who should write the report?

Every prospective and current PhD student should write the weekly report.

## Who will read my report?

Every member of LEMONADE can read your report.

## When should I send the weekly report?

You are recommended to send it around 6 pm on Friday. You should send it before 6 pm on Saturday.

The deadline is set on Saturday to discourage deadline rushing on the weekend, which in my opinion is not a good habit. However, you are free to work on Sunday and report your Sunday’s progress in the report next week.

## When will I receive a response?

I will not send my feedbacks before next Monday morning. This is to make sure that you are free for at least a day and half. However, you are welcome to reach me during the time.

## What should I include in the weekly report?

- summarize all your learning activities, including coding, reading and writing paper, preparing presentations, and school-related paperwork. These activities should add up to about 20 hours.
- briefly discuss your todos and plans next week.

## How should I summarize the activity?

Here are some Dos and Don’ts:

- Write in English. 学校相关杂事用中文。
- Write only two or three sentences for each activity.
- Each summarized activity looks very much the same like git commit messages.
- **Don’t use AI** to generate or refine the report. Writing the report is a part of self-reflection and I need your own words and thoughts.
- **Don’t include code or pictures**. Links are enough.
- **Don’t include confidential information**.

Here is a checklist every time you write the report:

- [ ] Explain why you had to do it.
- [ ] Evaluate if it is necessary or there is a better way to do it next time.
- [ ] Highlight your learning progress not project/code progress. Put coding activities to the end of the list.
- [ ] Attach links to your artifacts (github commits, onedrive document titles, overleaf repos).
